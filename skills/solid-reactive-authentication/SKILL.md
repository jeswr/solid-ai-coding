# @solid/reactive-authentication — auth via a patched fetch

Mental model first (companion guide: [`AGENTS.md`](https://github.com/jeswr/solid-ai-coding/blob/main/AGENTS.md) §Authentication): there is
**no session object and no authenticated-fetch wrapper**. `ReactiveFetchManager` patches
`globalThis.fetch` when you call `registerGlobally()` (the constructor alone does **not** patch
it in 0.1.3); afterwards every plain `fetch()` (including inside `@jeswr/fetch-rdf`) transparently
upgrades on `401` — find a matching provider, attach a DPoP-bound token, retry.

```sh
npm install @solid/reactive-authentication   # deps oauth4webapi + dpop come with it
```

Pure ESM, browser-only (custom elements, popups). In Next.js, import it **client-side only** —
the unguarded top-level `customElements.define` breaks `next build` otherwise; the mounting
recipe is in `AGENTS.md` §Mounting in Next.js.

## Published API (v0.1.2 — trust this over repo demos)

```ts
import {
  ReactiveFetchManager,          // new ReactiveFetchManager(providers: Iterable<TokenProvider>)
  DPoPTokenProvider,             // new DPoPTokenProvider(callbackUri, getCodeCallback) — 2 args
  BearerTokenProvider,           // demo-grade
  ClientCredentialsTokenProvider,// server-to-server (clientId, clientSecret)
  AuthorizationCodeFlow,         // the <authorization-code-flow> element class
  ReactiveFetchWorkerManager,    // service-worker variant — not production-ready in 0.1.x
  CodeRequestCancelledError, ReactiveFetchError,
} from "@solid/reactive-authentication";
import type { GetCodeCallback } from "@solid/reactive-authentication";
// GetCodeCallback = (authorizationUri: URL, signal: AbortSignal) => Promise<string>
```

Setup (full version with typing notes in `AGENTS.md`):

```ts
const ui = document.querySelector<AuthorizationCodeFlow>("authorization-code-flow")!;
const manager = new ReactiveFetchManager([
  new DPoPTokenProvider(new URL("/callback.html", location.href).toString(), ui.getCode.bind(ui)),
]);
manager.registerGlobally(); // 0.1.3: the constructor does NOT patch globalThis.fetch — this does
```

`/callback.html` (in `public/` for Next.js) contains the line
`<script>opener.postMessage(location.href)</script>`.

**Do not write code against** `IdpPicker`, `issuerFrom`, `GetIssuerCallback`, a 3-argument
`DPoPTokenProvider`, `registerElements`, or `AuthorizationCodeFlowUI` — these appear in the
repo/demos but are **not in the published 0.1.2**.

## Issuer resolution today

The published provider resolves the OIDC issuer **internally** from the resource URL's host:
`localhost:3000`, `*.solidcommunity.net`, `storage.inrupt.com` (PodSpaces), `*.solidweb.org`,
`*.solidweb.app`, `teamid.live`, `datapod.igrant.io`. Any other host **throws `Unknown
issuer`** — that error means the pod's host is outside the built-in map, not that your code is
wrong. A configurable issuer callback exists upstream and is expected in the next release.

⚠️ **Local CSS login is broken in 0.1.2** despite `localhost:3000` being on the list: the
issuer is hard-coded as `http://localhost:3000` and `oauth4webapi` refuses non-HTTPS issuers
(`OperationProcessingError: only requests to HTTPS are allowed`) with no app-level
`allowInsecureRequests` hook — and HTTPS-ing CSS doesn't help because the issuer URL is fixed.
Test interactive login against solidcommunity.net; use client-credentials DPoP tokens from the
CSS account API for local authenticated test traffic.

## Sessions, reloads, silent re-auth

Tokens live **in memory only**. A hard reload drops them; the next `401` re-runs the flow with
`prompt=none` first, so while the IdP cookie session lives, re-auth completes silently (no
popup). Prefer client-side navigation so the page (and its tokens) survive between views — and do
not roll your own *access*-token cache (it expires fast and the in-memory + `prompt=none` path
already covers in-session recovery).

### Reload-restore: persist the DPoP refresh token, restore via a refresh grant

`prompt=none` only restores silently **while the IdP cookie session is still alive**. For genuine
session *restore* — closing the tab (without logging out) and reopening later, after the IdP cookie
has expired or in a browser that drops third-party/IdP cookies (Safari ITP, privacy modes) — that
path fails and the user is bounced to login, which feels broken. The fix (a suite-wide UX invariant,
learned across prod-solid-server + jeswr/solid-pod-manager) is to persist the **DPoP-bound refresh
token**, not the access token, and restore from it on load:

- On login, store the **refresh token** in **IndexedDB**, keyed/scoped to the **WebID** (never
  `localStorage` — it is synchronous, size-capped, and readable by any same-origin script). The
  refresh token is DPoP-**bound**, so a leaked copy is useless without the matching private key.
- On load, before showing a login screen, attempt a silent **refresh-grant fetch** (an
  `oauth4webapi` refresh-token grant with a fresh DPoP proof) to mint new tokens — **no redirect, no
  hidden iframe.** Show a brief "restoring…" state; fall back to interactive login only on a genuine
  refresh failure (revoked/expired refresh token). Land back on the actual page, not the home screen.
- **Clear the persisted refresh token on logout** (and on a hard refresh failure), and keep it
  scoped per WebID so switching accounts can't cross the streams.
- Schedule a **proactive** refresh before access-token expiry (and re-check on `visibilitychange`
  resume) rather than waiting for a `401` — see the proactive-refresh testing subsection above for
  how to test that deterministically.

This is what upstream issue [reactive-authentication#15](https://github.com/solid-contrib/reactive-authentication/issues/15)
("optional `SessionStore` so reloads restore via a refresh grant") tracks; until the library ships
it, a consumer holds the IndexedDB store itself. (Cited: prod-solid-server auth architecture +
the Pod-Manager / suite "silent session restore on load" UX invariant, jeswr/solid-pod-manager.)

### Testing proactive refresh with fake timers

If you build a **proactive token-refresh** provider — one that schedules a refresh before
expiry rather than waiting for a `401` — testing it with vitest fake timers is racy (lesson
from a prod-solid-server consumer). A refresh cycle awaits real **WebCrypto** (oauth4webapi
DPoP-proof signing + ES256 sign/verify), which runs on the libuv threadpool and settles on the
**real** macrotask queue, not the fake clock — so draining with a fixed count of
`advanceTimersByTimeAsync(0)` rounds is non-deterministic (under load the crypto isn't done
when assertions run). Instead:

- Expose **observable seams** on the provider, both production no-ops (undefined unless
  injected): `onProactiveCycleStarted` at the top of the single cycle method *all* trigger
  paths funnel through (timer fire, backoff retry, visibility-resume), and
  `onProactiveCycleSettled` in a `finally` once refresh + persist + reschedule has settled.
- Count STARTED vs SETTLED and **wait on the settled seam, not a time budget**: positive
  assertions poll for the expected settled count; "nothing more happens" assertions drain
  until quiescent. Between checks, yield to a `setTimeout` captured *before* `useFakeTimers`
  so threadpool crypto can settle, bounded by a real wall-clock deadline (pre-captured
  `Date.now`) that throws with context on overrun. Reset counters per-test.
- **Pitfall:** count STARTED at the *provider* level, not in the timer wrapper — a
  resume-triggered cycle that bypasses the timer fires SETTLED without a matching STARTED, and
  `settle()` then wrongly treats an in-flight refresh as quiescent.

## Letting users pick their Solid server — behaviour spec + tested code

How should login *feel*? The reference behaviour comes from the Solid browser extension
([theodi/solid-browser-extension](https://github.com/theodi/solid-browser-extension)), which
implements the same reactive model. Two layers of **tested reference code** are bundled with
this skill:

1. **[`webid-token-provider.ts`](./webid-token-provider.ts)** — `WebIdDPoPTokenProvider`, a
   complete custom `TokenProvider` (a port of the published `DPoPTokenProvider` flow) whose
   issuer comes from the user's WebID: `getWebId` callback (a native-`<dialog>` reference
   implementation `promptWebIdDialog` is included) → profile dereference → `solid:oidcIssuer`
   resolution → `chooseIssuer` when several (default **throws** `AmbiguousIssuerError`, never
   silently first). Its `allowInsecureLoopback` option also makes **interactive login against
   local CSS work** — the one thing the published provider cannot do. **E2E-verified**: a
   headless Playwright run drives the full popup login (WebID dialog → CSS login → consent →
   authenticated read) against a live local CSS, 3/3 stable — see
   [`webid-token-provider.e2e.md`](./webid-token-provider.e2e.md) for the verification record.
   ```ts
   const manager = new ReactiveFetchManager([
     new WebIdDPoPTokenProvider(callbackUri, ui.getCode.bind(ui), promptWebIdDialog,
       { allowInsecureLoopback: true }),  // loopback-only; remote issuers stay HTTPS-strict
   ]);
   manager.registerGlobally(); // 0.1.3: required to patch globalThis.fetch
   ```
2. **[`login-ux.ts`](./login-ux.ts)** (vitest suite [`login-ux.test.ts`](./login-ux.test.ts),
   9 tests) — the UX helpers the provider composes with: `validateWebId`, `resolveIssuers`,
   `fetchLoginCandidate` (WebID → issuers + display name + avatar in one read), and
   `RecentAccounts` (most-recent-first, deduplicated, corruption-safe, remembers the chosen
   issuer and storage per account).

Copy both into `src/lib/` and build your UI on them. The behaviour to implement:

1. **WebID-first entry.** The login surface asks for one thing: the user's **WebID** (a URL
   input). No identity-provider dropdown, no server list — users know their WebID, not their
   IdP's OIDC URL.
2. **Recent accounts.** Remember previously used accounts as `{ webId, displayName, avatar }`,
   most recent first, de-duplicated by WebID. Returning users see avatar buttons (photo or
   initials) and tap one to re-login; an **"Add account"** affordance reveals the WebID input.
   Keep this list on logout (logout clears the session, not the account memory).
3. **WebID → issuer.** Dereference the WebID and read `solid:oidcIssuer` from the profile —
   through `@jeswr/fetch-rdf` + `WebIdDataset`, **never** by regex-scraping Turtle (a known
   fragility of the extension's first implementation: it misses prefixed and multi-line forms).
   - **No issuer** → actionable error: "This WebID can't be used for Solid login — its profile
     has no `solid:oidcIssuer`."
   - **Multiple issuers** → let the user choose; do not take the first.
4. **Run the flow.** Trigger the authorization-code flow against the chosen issuer (the
   `<authorization-code-flow>` popup handles user interaction). Validate errors into clear UI
   states: malformed WebID, unreachable profile, cancelled popup (`CodeRequestCancelledError`).
5. **After login.** Fetch the profile and render the account (name/avatar via the
   `ProfileAgent` reference class in the `solid-object` skill); append it to recent accounts.
6. **Storage selection.** When the profile advertises more than one `pim:storage`, **ask the
   user which storage to use** — never pick one silently. Remember the choice per account.

## Gotchas

| Gotcha | Detail |
|---|---|
| Construct + `registerGlobally()` **once, early** | The constructor does NOT patch `globalThis.fetch` in 0.1.3 — `registerGlobally()` does; do it before any library captures a `fetch` reference, or those calls bypass auth |
| Untyped `querySelector` fails to compile | The library doesn't augment `HTMLElementTagNameMap` — use `querySelector<AuthorizationCodeFlow>(…)` |
| `Unknown issuer` | Host outside the 0.1.2 built-in map — see above |
| `only requests to HTTPS are allowed` on local login | The 0.1.2 HTTP-issuer wall — use the bundled `WebIdDPoPTokenProvider` with `allowInsecureLoopback: true` for local CSS |
| CSS-only auth failure `iat is not recent enough` | A *second* auth layer sending ms-unit DPoP `iat`; this library is correct — remove the other layer |
| Worker mode | `ReactiveFetchWorkerManager` registers a repo-relative worker path; treat as not production-ready in 0.1.x |
